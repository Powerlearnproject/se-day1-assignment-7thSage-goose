#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
    Software engineering is the planning and developing of software in such a way that it is widely accessible and easy to       understand.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
   1. The birth of software engineering:In the 1960s NATO coined the term "software engineering" to combat the crisis of           unreliable software.This marked the fist intances of developing structured programming and modular design concepts.
    2. Open Source Movement:The growth of the open source movement took place in the 1990s pioneered by projects like the           Linux operating systemand the apache web server.
    3.AI and Machine Learning in Software Engineering:In the 2020s there is an increasing use of Artificial Inteligence and       Machine Learning to automate various aspects of software development.
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
   1.Requirement Analysis is the phase where a developer gathers the requirements from the client to understand their needs       and documents them.
    2.System Design is the phase where the developer defines the design of the system.
    3.Implimentation is the phase of active codingto develop the software according to the design specifications
    4.The Testing phase is when the developer verifies that the software meets the specificationsand does not have any bugs       or errors.
    5.Deployment is the phase where the software is released into the client's use for its intended purpose.
    6.Maintenance is meant to ensure that the software continues to fuction per its specifications.
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
    The Waterfall methodology leans more towards a single cycle of development compared to the Agile methodology that favors     a constant continuation of the development cycle. While the WAterfall methodology is useful in a situation whereth           requirements are clear and presise, the Agile fills the gap when requirements are prone to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
    A software developer is responsible for designing, coding, and maintaining software applications. A Quality Assurance        Engineer ensures the software meets quality standards and functions as intended. A Project Mananger has to oversee the       entire Software development process ensuring deadlines are met in a timely manner and that the Project meets the             client's expectations.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
    IDEs and VCS are the backbone of Software development.They allow seamless collaboration between teams where they can         build, maintain and deliver high quality software with efficiency.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
    Chalanges that are faced by software engineers include: Tight deadlines; Require ments that change in the middle of the design process and Technical dept. To strategically combat these Challanges a developer can prioritize tasks by importance 
    effectively communicate with clients and peers.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
    Unit testing focuses on verifying the smallest testable components of a software application, it ensures the correctness of individual components. Integration testing verifies the interaction between different modules or compenents of the software, it validates the interactions between components. Acceptance testing is where the software is evaluated to ensure it meets the client's requirements and is ready for delivery to the end user, it finaly ensure that the software complies with industry standard and regulatioins.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
    Prompt engineering is the proccess of generating AI prompts that will yield more acurete and consise information from an     AI model

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
    " What is does Samsung do?" As opposed to "What contributions has Samsung made for the progerssion of technology in the last decade." the improved prompt incourages the AI to focus on the details of how the company Samsung has contributed to the tech industry and it has futher restricted the search to the last decade as opposed to the entire history of Samsung.
